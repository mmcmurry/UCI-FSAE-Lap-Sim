This is the GitHub Pages website for University of California, Irvine's Formula SAE team's lap simulator. 
  
To use, download Lap Sim.py as well as the two .txt track map files. Open Lap Sim.py and change the file paths around line 186 to match where your track files are saved.

For testing the new Drivetrain class, you only need "Lap sim.py".
